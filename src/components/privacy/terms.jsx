                      <p>Our terms of service describe what InfluxIdea does for you and the charities and other good causes you support, and what we kindly request of you as
                        a user in return.</p>
                      <p>We operate in a number of countries and these core terms of service apply in each. There are some country specific terms which also apply. Relevant country

                      <p>Here are the key points:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Online Giving - we run and maintain a website that processes donations on behalf of the charities and other good causes featured on it. For this service,
                          and the support we provide to them and their supporters, charities and other good causes pay us a transaction fee of up to 5% on the donation. Because
                          we promptly pay donations to charities and other good causes, we regret that we can only refund a donation in exceptional circumstances, as described
                          below.</li>
                        <li>Data Protection - Your privacy is paramount to us. Our <a href="https://www.InfluxIdea.com/info/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> shows you how we protect
                          it.</li>
                        <li>User Conduct - If you create a InfluxIdea page or use any of our other services, please remember InfluxIdea is for everyone. We’ll remove offensive,
                          obscene or racist content on the rare occasions when we find it – and we may terminate membership as a result. Please also make sure that the content
                          you upload to the site, especially pictures and videos, does not infringe another person’s copyright.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>InfluxIdea is a trading name of the local InfluxIdea entity as identified in the country specific terms of service. InfluxIdea operates www.InfluxIdea.com
                        (the "Website") and its associated services. These core terms of service (and the relevant country specific terms) (together the "Terms of Service")

                        of Service, you should not continue to use or access the Website or its associated services.</p>
                      <p>These Terms of Service may change or be updated from time to time. It remains your responsibility to access and check these Terms of Service wherever
                        you access the Website. The latest version of these Terms of Service will govern any future usage by you of the Website and its associated services.

                      <h2>About the charities, good causes and organisations featured on the Website</h2>
                      <p>The Website and its associated services allows you to donate to, and raise funds for, any of the causes listed on the Website ("Causes") which could
                        include charities, certain non-charitable good causes referred to on the Website as InfluxIdea Crowdfunding ("InfluxIdea Crowdfunding") and other listed
                        organisations. Every Cause featured has a contractual agreement with InfluxIdea authorising InfluxIdea to collect donations on its behalf. Causes are
                        listed on this Website at InfluxIdea's discretion, however we cannot accept responsibility for the activities of the Causes. A charity must have the
                        appropriate authorisation, permit or licence to operate as a charity, as required by the local laws of the territory in which it operates. You should
                        note that InfluxIdea Crowdfunding pages are not intended to raise money for charities, so you should read the description of them carefully and be
                        happy that they are genuine and suitable to receive your donation. Different charities, terms used on InfluxIdea Crowdfunding pages and other organisations
                        can have similar names: it is your responsibility to check that you are donating to the Cause you intended.</p>
                      <h2>Donations</h2>
                      <p>Subject to the requirements of applicable local laws, and what we say below in relation to InfluxIdea Crowdfunding, once your donation is made, it will
                        only be refunded to you with the prior written consent of the Cause to whom it has been made, regardless of whether or not the donation had been paid
                        to the Cause by InfluxIdea. You should therefore get in touch with the charity or other good cause first. Before a donation is refunded, the relevant
                        Cause must agree that InfluxIdea may, subject to local applicable laws, deduct the amount to be refunded from subsequent payments to be made by InfluxIdea
                        to the Cause. Where no further payments are due to be made to such Cause within one (1) week of the refund being made to you, InfluxIdea reserves the
                        right to invoice the Cause for the amount of the refund and the Cause must agree to settle that invoice within one (1) month of the date of the invoice.</p>
                      <p>In relation to InfluxIdea Crowdfunding, InfluxIdea will charge your donation to your payment card account (or other payment method available on the Website)
                        at the time of donating. For donations made to InfluxIdea Crowdfunding no refunds will be provided, subject to applicable local laws. If you do not
                        agree to this you should not use the Website to make donations to InfluxIdea Crowdfunding pages. Occasionally, the person who created the page you
                        have donated to does not pass identity verification or other necessary checks, or there is some other reason that we can’t transfer the funds to them.
                        If this happens to a page you have donated to, we’ll email you to let you know that your donation will be sent to another Cause instead, subject to
                        the deduction of our usual transaction and payment processing fees (as described below). We appreciate that you may prefer to get your money back,
                        so if you request a refund within seven (7) days of receiving this email, we will refund your donation to your payment method (normally within a few
                        working days).</p>
                      <h2>Use of your donation</h2>
                      <p>InfluxIdea does not warrant that your donations will be used for any particular    purpose and shall not be responsible for any dissatisfaction you may
                        have regarding the recipient Cause's use of any donation you may make through the Website or its associated services or websites powered by us or for
                        any misuse or non-use of such donations by the recipient Cause. After donations are made, all further dealings are solely between the donor and such
                        recipient. Please note that for donations to InfluxIdea Crowdfunding pages, you may receive updates from the page creator to let you know more about
                        their cause. If you would like to stop receiving these emails, you will be able to select this option in the email footer.</p>
                      <p>Please note that recipient organisations (excluding InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page creators) reserve the right to use your donation for their general purposes.
                        They will use your donation for any purpose in accordance with their own rules. InfluxIdea cannot guarantee that funds will be earmarked for a particular
                        appeal. If you want your donation to be used for a specific purpose or for a particular appeal you should contact the organisation and make your donation
                        directly to them.</p>
                      <p>InfluxIdea (or any payments platform we work with) will verify the identity of a   InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page creator and undertake any other necessary
                        checks before any funds raised are transferred to the page creator. InfluxIdea shall have no liability to donors whatsoever for any use or misuse of
                        donations made to the InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page. The InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page may state that they will use donations only for specific purposes,
                        but InfluxIdea cannot guarantee that they will use it for such purpose. If you have any doubts as to how the money will be spent then you should contact
                        the InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page owner directly to seek reassurance. It is your sole responsibility, as a user of the Website, to ensure that the cause
                        stated to be supported on a relevant InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page is one that you wish to support.</p>
                      <h2>InfluxIdea fees</h2>
                      <p>InfluxIdea charges a small transaction fee on every donation made on the Website or its associated services. The fee is currently up to 5% of the gross
                        donation. Donations are also subject to third party payment processing fees. Subscription fees also apply to member charities in the UK for additional
                        services. For full details please visit <a href="https://www.InfluxIdea.com/charities">www.InfluxIdea.com/charities</a>.</p>
                      <h2>Unauthorised donations</h2>
                      <p>When you make a donation the transaction is final and not disputable unless unauthorised use of your payment card or other payment method is proved.
                        If you become aware of fraudulent use of your card, or if it is lost or stolen, you must notify your card provider in accordance with its reporting
                        rules. Similarly, if you experience any issues of this nature when using another payment method, such as PayPal, you should contact the provider of
                        that payment method for assistance.</p>
                      <p>InfluxIdea will never email or phone you and ask you to provide all of your payment details.</p>
                      <h2>Protecting your account</h2>
                      <p>When you register with InfluxIdea and choose a password to protect your secure account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
                        password to prevent others gaining access to your personal information. This includes any taxpayer details you may have saved under your profile in
                        order to claim Gift Aid. Claiming Gift Aid using someone else’s taxpayer information is against the law. If you become aware of any unauthorised use
                        of your account, we recommend that you change your password immediately and call our helpdesk on the telephone number set out on the <a href="https://www.InfluxIdea.com/en/contact-us">Contact Us page</a>.</p>
                      <h2>Information</h2>
                      <p>InfluxIdea is not an accounting, taxation or financial advisor, and you should not rely on information given on the Website or its associated services
                        to determine the accounting, tax or financial consequences of making a donation to a Cause. We strongly recommend that you consult your own adviser(s)
                        about any accounting, taxation or financial consequences that may affect you.</p>
                      <h2>Privacy</h2>
                      <p>InfluxIdea's Privacy Policy forms part of these Terms of Service. By agreeing to these Terms of Service you also give your consent to the way we may

                          services at its sole discretion and without notice, regardless of whether or not it is, in the opinion of any third party, offensive, obscene, racist,

                        <li>If you build a fundraising page on InfluxIdea, you must ensure that any information you provide to the public is accurate and not misleading. It is
                          your responsibility to ensure that the content you are uploading on your page (“Content”), in particular the picture(s), photograph(s) and any video(s)

                        <li>Other than in relation to your own InfluxIdea fundraising page or InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page, you may not remove or change anything on the Website.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>In addition, you as a user must not:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any other person or organisation;</li>
                        <li>use the Website to send junk email or 'spam' to people who do not wish to receive email from you;</li>
                        <li>use the Website to conduct, display or forward surveys, pyramid schemes or chain letters;</li>
                        <li>use the Website to conduct, display or forward raffles, lotteries or contests, unless you have obtained any necessary licence or permission and you
                          comply with all applicable laws;</li>
                        <li>interfere with, or disrupt, the service or services or networks connected to the service and introduce any computer virus (including any variant or
                          similar malicious code or instructions) to the InfluxIdea systems; or</li>
                        <li>disclose any information relating to any donor except with the consent of the donor or as permitted by applicable local laws.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>InfluxIdea reserves the right to cancel your membership and delete any InfluxIdea page without notice in the event of a breach of the above rules. InfluxIdea
                        may also suspend or delete a InfluxIdea page if the relevant charity is no longer receiving donations via InfluxIdea.</p>
                      <p>Building a InfluxIdea page in aid of a Cause in no way implies InfluxIdea's or the Cause's endorsement of your fundraising activity. Many Causes disapprove
                        of, and do not wish to be involved in, dangerous sports or unusual challenges. It is your responsibility to check with the Cause first that your chosen
                        activity does not contravene the Cause's policies. InfluxIdea reserves the right, at its absolute discretion and without notice, to cancel your personal
                        fundraising page at the request of the Cause, in the event that the Cause, in its absolute discretion, deems your fundraising activity inappropriate
                        or unnecessarily dangerous.</p>
                      <h2>Links</h2>
                      <p>The Website and its associated services contains links to other websites, including the websites of Causes. Inclusion of a link to another website does
                        not imply endorsement of its content or opinions. Your relationship and any transactions with other people or organisations through their websites
                        or otherwise are your own responsibility.</p>
                      <h2>Partner Services</h2>
                      <p>InfluxIdea may from time to time select partners offering relevant information and services that we believe will enhance our provision for visitors to
                        the Website. Whilst we will do our best to select partners of the highest integrity, we are not responsible for any aspect of the information or services
                        offered by them, and if you choose to use their services you do so at your own risk.</p>
                      <h2>Trademarks</h2>
                      <p>The names InfluxIdea, InfluxIdea Crowdfunding and InfluxIdea.com, the InfluxIdea logo and any other product and service names that we may present on
                        the Website or its associated services from time to time may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not InfluxIdea's, nor in
                        any manner that is likely to cause confusion, or in any way that may disparage or discredit InfluxIdea. Other trademarks, service marks or logos that
                        appear on the Website or its associated services, in particular (but not exclusively) those of member charities, InfluxIdea Crowdfunding pages or other

                      <h2 id="uk-terms">SPECIFIC TERMS OF SERVICE FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM AND ALL COUNTRIES OTHER THAN AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED STATES (SAVE WHERE INDICATED OTHERWISE)</h2>
                      <p>These additional terms apply and will prevail where you access the Website or associated services in the United Kingdom or any other part of the world
                        (other than Australia and the United States).</p>
                      <p>The local InfluxIdea entity and the company who provides the service to you is Giving.com Limited (registration no. 3871904), whose registered office
                        is at 2nd Floor, Blue Fin Building, 110 Southwark Street, London, SE1 0TA, United Kingdom. Giving.com Limited has registered a representative office
                        in Hong Kong (with business registration no. 55189291-000 and the address 18/F, Edinburgh Tower, The Landmark, 15 Queen’s Road Central, Hong Kong).</p>
                      <p id="gift-aid">Gift Aid and tax (this section is applicable to UK Tax Payers only)</p>
                      <p>When you donate to a charity and certain Community Amateur Sports Clubs ("CASCs") on the Website or its associated services and confirm that you are
                        a UK taxpayer in accordance with the requirements of the Gift Aid scheme as they apply from time to time, InfluxIdea reclaims Gift Aid on behalf of
                        the charity or CASC under the UK government's Gift Aid scheme.</p>
                      <p>Every charity or CASC that is a member of InfluxIdea has a contractual agreement with InfluxIdea authorising it to reclaim Gift Aid on its behalf. Charities
                        and CASCs must be registered with the Charity Commission or exempt from registration for InfluxIdea to reclaim Gift Aid on their behalf. InfluxIdea
                        also features certain not-for-profit and other organisations, which are not eligible for Gift Aid reclaim. Such organisations are clearly listed on
                        the Website as not eligible for Gift Aid reclaim. In addition, donations to InfluxIdea Crowdfunding pages, including those that have a charitable purpose,
                        are not eligible for Gift Aid. Donations to any of these Causes are not tax deductible.</p>
                      <p>When a donation is eligible for Gift Aid reclaim, the fee InfluxIdea charges is up to 5% of the gross donation, which is the donation plus any Gift Aid
                        reclaimed. When a donation is not eligible for Gift Aid reclaim, the up to 5% fee applies to the donation alone.</p>
                      <p>Non member charities (applies to the UK only)</p>
                      <p>InfluxIdea also runs a "non member charity" service. This means InfluxIdea may also feature on our Website most of the charities registered with the
                        Charity Commission for England and Wales, even if they are not one of our member charities. We have made arrangements to allow donations to be made
                        to non member charities through the InfluxIdea Foundation, who will collect Gift Aid on their behalf. The InfluxIdea Foundation provides a purely administrative
                        role in collecting donations and reclaiming Gift Aid on behalf of the non member charities.</p>
                      <p>When InfluxIdea sends a donation to a non member charity that falls under (i) above, InfluxIdea will send the non member charity a cheque for the donation
                        plus the Gift Aid, minus InfluxIdea 's standard 5% fee (see the <a href="#gift-aid" target="_top">Gift Aid and tax</a> section above). If the non member
                        charity accepts the donation by cashing the cheque an agreement will be formed with InfluxIdea. If they do not accept the cheque they will not enter
                        into any agreement with InfluxIdea and the donation will not be processed. It may take up to six months from when InfluxIdea passes your donation on
                        to the charity to confirm that the donation will not be processed as cheques are valid for this period. If the non member charity sends the cheque
                        back to InfluxIdea earlier, InfluxIdea is unable to make payment or doesn't feel it is appropriate to pass on a donation (for example, if a charity
                        has been de-registered by the Charity Commission or has a sanction listed against them) then InfluxIdea will contact you so as to return the donation
                        to you. If InfluxIdea is unable to contact you then InfluxIdea will select an appropriate alternative charity to pass the donation to.</p>
                      <p>JustTextGiving is one of InfluxIdea's associated services. It is a text giving service that processes donations and InfluxIdea reclaims Gift Aid on behalf
                        of the charities featured on it. InfluxIdea does not currently charge charities or donors for this service, although InfluxIdea reserves the right
                        to charge the transaction fee in the future. If InfluxIdea does decide to charge for the service, InfluxIdea will tell you in advance.</p>
                      <p>Text donations may be refunded in certain circumstances (such as where the donation was sent from your mobile phone by mistake or without your permission)
                        at the absolute discretion of your mobile phone operator. If you wish to request a refund you should contact your mobile phone operator to discuss
                        this with them. There is no obligation for your mobile phone operator to provide a refund and they may choose to refund only part of the donation if
                        they wish. Because InfluxIdea pays donations made via text to charities regularly, we regret that we can only refund a text donation if the charity
                        expressly requests it, and they can pay us back. Please get in touch with the charity first.</p>
                      <p>Your mobile operator will pass 100% of the text donation onto InfluxIdea. The minimum text donation is GBP £1 and all donations must be in whole pounds
                        sterling. The maximum text donation allowed is GBP £10 for all mobile operators. Donations sent via text will usually incur your standard text message
                        fee. Please refer to your tariff for details of your standard text message fee.</p>
                      <p>After you send a donation via text, InfluxIdea will send you a text message in response, confirming your donation and providing you with the opportunity
                        to add Gift Aid to your donation. InfluxIdea will include a link to a Gift Aid page where you can provide your details to enable InfluxIdea to collect
                        Gift Aid on your behalf. Alternatively, InfluxIdea may send you a text message asking if you would like to add Gift Aid to your donation and to reply
                        to this text message giving your name, address and postcode. For each reply you send to InfluxIdea text messages regarding Gift Aid your mobile operator
                        will charge you one standard text message fee.</p>
                      <p>User conduct - you, as a user of the Website, must not provide a donor with any gift, prize or any other form of incentive in connection with the making
                        of any donation by the donor, unless you have obtained any necessary licence or permission, you comply with all applicable laws, and your fundraising
                        page makes clear to donors that they cannot claim Gift Aid on their donation as it is in return for something.</p>
                      <p>InfluxIdea fees - All payments referred to in these Terms of Service are exclusive of Value Added Tax, where applicable.</p>
                      <p>Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability - The times at which InfluxIdea shall undertake general maintenance and upkeep of the Website will usually be

                        the associated services are governed by English law and are subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.</p>

                      <p>These additional terms apply and will prevail where you access the Website or associated services in Australia.</p>

                      <p>Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability - If you live in Australia, the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) may confer rights, guarantees and remedies
                        on you in relation to the provision by InfluxIdea of services on the Website, which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified. InfluxIdea does not
                        exclude, restrict or modify those rights.</p>
                      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, InfluxIdea's liability for breach of any consumer guarantee, which cannot be excluded, is limited at the option
                        of InfluxIdea to, in the case of services supplied or offered by InfluxIdea which are not of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household
                        use or consumption (i) the supply of the services again; or (ii) the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.</p>
                      <p>The times at which InfluxIdea shall undertake general maintenance and upkeep of the Website will usually be between 12.00am and 08.00 hours (GMT) at

                      <h2 id="us-terms">SPECIFIC TERMS OF SERVICE FOR THE UNITED STATES</h2>
                      <p>These additional terms apply and will prevail where you access the Website or associated services in the United States, or you are donating to a campaign
                        that benefits a U.S. 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity.</p>
                      <p>The local InfluxIdea entity and the company who provides the service to you in the United States is JG US, Inc., a Delaware corporation whose principal
                        place of business is We Work Grand Central, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York NY 10017.</p>
                      <p>In fundraising campaigns for certain Causes on the InfluxIdea website, donations are made through JustGive, Inc., a U.S. 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization
                        that operates a donor-advised fund to process donations and make grants to other U.S. 501(c)(3) tax-exempt public charities pursuant to donor advisements.
                        When you make a donation to support these Causes, you are making a complete and final charitable donation to JustGive, Inc., with a recommendation
                        that the funds be re-granted to the Cause specified on the campaign page, and you will receive a donation receipt from JustGive for your donor-advised
                        contribution. It is JustGive’s normal practice to regrant approximately 92% of the donation per advisement to any qualifying Cause, and to retain 5%
                        for platform costs and JustGive’s expenses, plus credit card processing costs. JustGive makes payments to Causes about 15 days after the end of each
                        month. JustGive makes every effort to comply with donor recommendations and to re-grant the funds to the donor’s designated Cause. However, to comply
                        with federal tax laws and regulations, JustGive is required to retain legal control over any charitable contribution it receives. In rare instances,
                        JustGive may determine that it would be inappropriate or improper to disburse the funds designated for a Cause because, for example, the Cause is no
                        longer recognized as a public charity, or is no longer in good standing with state or federal regulations, in which case, JustGive may, in its sole
                        discretion, disburse the donation to another charity (as determined by JustGive).</p>
                      <p>No Solicitation or Endorsement</p>
                      <p>The listing or display of a Cause on the Website does not constitute a solicitation of donations; InfluxIdea does not engage in any solicitation activities
                        on behalf of, or endorse, any of the Causes appearing on the Website, nor does it consult on the solicitation of contributions, on behalf of any individual,
                        entity, or organization.</p>
                      <p>Unless otherwise specifically indicated, InfluxIdea does not endorse and has no affiliation with any of the Causes. In regard to any information or content
                        that may be included to describe the Cause, InfluxIdea has not independently verified any of the information or content provided, and the sole and
                        complete responsibility to assess, review and verify the suitability of any Cause you want to support through your donation rests entirely with you.</p>

                      <p>If you create a InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page on the Website the following additional terms will apply to your dealings with InfluxIdea in relation to
                        the relevant InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page and your use of the Website and associated services. To the extent there is any conflict between these additional
                        terms and the core Terms of Service, these additional terms will prevail.</p>
                      <p>Donations and bank Trust Funds Accounts</p>
                      <p>InfluxIdea will:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Maintain Trust Funds Accounts at Barclays Bank PLC in London in relation to donations made to InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page (excluding InfluxIdea Crowdfunding
                          page creators based in the U.S., who must connect their InfluxIdea Crowdfunding Page through a verified PayPal account).</li>
                        <li>These are bank accounts in which monies (other than the interest accruing on such monies) are held on trust for InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page creators
                          and other Causes and do not belong to InfluxIdea;</li>
                        <li>Operate the Website so that donors can make online donations by credit or debit card, or by another payment method available on the Website, through
                          your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page;</li>
                        <li>Set up arrangements to ensure that all donations received by InfluxIdea (after deduction of payment processing charges, InfluxIdea's transaction fees
                          as set out below and applicable sales taxes) are:</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Paid into the Trust Funds Accounts and are held on trust for your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding; and</li>
                          <li>Paid out from the Trust Funds Accounts by bank transfer to your bank account, or by any other payment method that you have selected via the Website
                            (for example, payment to a PayPal account that you have connected to your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page. Please note that all crowdfunders based
                            in the USA will need to connect their InfluxIdea Crowdfunding Page to a PayPal account). Such payments will normally be made no later than 10 business
                            days after the end of the funding period for the InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page, provided that you have passed identity verification and other necessary
                            checks. If you do not pass these checks by the end of the funding period, InfluxIdea will normally notify you of this and give you a further period
                            of time (usually five (5) months) to pass the checks. Towards the end of this period, you will receive a final reminder by email letting you know
                            that you have seven (7) days left to pass. If you take no action or still do not pass by the end of these 7 days, InfluxIdea shall apply the donations
                            made to your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page to another Cause instead (or refund the donors if they prefer); and</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Provide information systems design, testing and verification standards and requirements in accordance with good industry practice to ensure that donors'
                          credit cards, debit cards and other payment types are debited and the Trust Funds Account is credited in a secure manner.</li>
                      </ul>

                        InfluxIdea does not check or exercise any editorial control over the content of such information, save as required by applicable laws. In the event

                          (ii) not do, or cause or permit to be done, anything which may result in a breach by InfluxIdea of the Privacy Laws and comply with all reasonable
                          instructions from InfluxIdea relating to the processing by you and/or the InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page of such Personal Information; (iii) comply
                          with the Privacy Laws in respect of your and/or the InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page's collection, use, disclosure or processing of the Personal Information;

                          to fundraise on your behalf) in accordance with applicable laws and if InfluxIdea needs any such authority, permit, licence, consent, approval or
                          registration for it to fundraise on behalf of the InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page then you will, at no cost to InfluxIdea, provide all such assistance

                          to operate the fundraising activities in relation to the InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page in accordance with applicable local laws.</li>
                        <li>By building a InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page you represent, warrant and undertake to InfluxIdea and the users of the Website that:</li>
                        <ul>

                            guidelines that apply to InfluxIdea Crowdfunding pages at that time (currently available <a href="https://help.InfluxIdea.com/hc/en-us/articles/202895531">here</a>);</li>
                          <li>you will provide feedback via your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page on the Website, including at the end of the fundraising period to explain what outcome
                            has been or will be achieved as a result (including how any funds raised in excess of your target will be used); all donations provided to the
                            InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page will be used for the purposes set out on your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page; and</li>
                          <li>no fraudulent, criminal or otherwise improper uses will be made of donations made via your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page.</li>

                        If you are between 13 and the age of majority in the country where you live (usually 18 years of age), then you may only set up a InfluxIdea Crowdfunding

                      <p>Licence of Trademark and Copyrighted Material</p>
                      <p>You hereby grant to InfluxIdea, its affiliates and its partners a non exclusive licence to use any of your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page's trademarks

                        services and its operation and promotion and for no other purpose whatsoever.</p>
                      <p>The licence shall terminate automatically on expiry or termination of these Terms of Service or the removal of your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page from
                        the Website in accordance with these Terms of Service.</p>
                      <p>Fees</p>
                      <p>In consideration of using the Website and associated services, you shall pay a transaction fee to InfluxIdea of 5% of the gross amount of every donation.</p>
                      <p>InfluxIdea is, subject to applicable laws, hereby authorised to deduct the transaction fee together with applicable taxes and payment processing charges
                        from the donations provided to you under these Terms of Service.</p>
                      <p>Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</p>
                      <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the <a href="#disclaimer" target="_top">"Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability"</a> section of the core Terms of Service,
                        InfluxIdea's total liability to you arising under or in connection with these Terms of Service, so far as such liability arises out of or relates to
                        your creation and/or use of a InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page, shall be limited to the total fees paid by you to InfluxIdea under these Terms of Service
                        for your use of the Website and associated services during the preceding 12 month period ending on the date the circumstances giving rise to the liability
                        arose.</p>
                      <p>Confidential Information</p>
                      <p>During the funding period of your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page and for a period of seven (7) years thereafter, the parties shall treat as strictly confidential
                        all information about the other which has been acquired as a result of the use of the Website and associated services and which is not in the public
                        domain. No party shall use or disclose to any third party such information belonging to the other party without that party's prior written consent,
                        except where required to do so by applicable law, including, without limitation, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information
                        Regulations 2004, or regulatory or governmental body. This paragraph shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.</p>
                      <p>Termination</p>
                      <p>InfluxIdea reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to immediately and without notice suspend or permanently deny your access to all or part of the
                        Website and associated services, including for example by removing any InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page from the Website. InfluxIdea will only exercise
                        this right where there is a breach or suspected breach by you of these Terms of Service (including where there is any actual or suspected fraudulent,
                        criminal or improper use of the Website or associated services) or where InfluxIdea has any other legitimate reason to do so. These Terms of Service
                        shall terminate automatically upon the removal by you or InfluxIdea of your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page from the Website. These Terms of Service will
                        continue to apply to past use by you.</p>
                      <p>Upon termination or suspension or denial of access to the Website and associated services, funds already received on your behalf by InfluxIdea will be
                        handled in accordance with the provisions above, provided that any potential payment (where applicable) may be delayed where InfluxIdea conducts an
                        investigation regarding your use of the Website and associated services and InfluxIdea may decide to refuse to pay funds across to you where you have
                        breached these Terms of Service or your InfluxIdea Crowdfunding page has been removed. In such circumstances InfluxIdea may authorise a refund of donations
                        to donors.</p>
